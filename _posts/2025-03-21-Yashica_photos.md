With some confidence that the [shutter is usable](photography/Yashica_MinisterII_Shutter/), I shot and developed a roll of Kentmere 100 in the Yashica.

{% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/posts/2025-03-21/yashica_2.jpg" alt="A black and white photo of two people looking over a lake"%}
{% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/posts/2025-03-21/yashica_3.jpg" alt="A black and white photo of train tracks leading to a steel mill in the background"%}
{% include figure popup=true image_path="/assets/posts/2025-03-21/yashica_4.jpg" alt="A black and white photo of a steel mill blast furnace with its reflecting in a river"%}

Overall I had a lot of fun shooting with this camera.  It was my first time using a rangefinder, and I do see their appeal.  I only managed to take a photo with the lens cap on once!  That being said, the lens certainly has a lot of character and many photos appear soft, and the metering will take practice to consistently get what I had in mind.  The contrast generally was low too, though I don't know if this due to the film and how I developed it or something intrinsic to the lens.

I think I'll continue to primarily use my FE, but this will be nice to use once in a while to change things up.
