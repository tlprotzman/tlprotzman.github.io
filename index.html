<h1>Tristan Protzman</h1>
<h2>Physicist, Programmer, Musician</h2>
<p>Welcome to my website!  It is very early in construction as you can probably guess!</p>
<p>I am a junior at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute pursuing a BS in physics and computer science.</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>
<h3>High Performance Computing</h3>
<p>
    Going into physics, I quickly realized a field of it which interests me greatly is computational physics,
    particularly large scale high performance computing.  To satisfy my itch to learn more about the field, I started
    working with <a href="http://homepages.rpi.edu/~giedtj/">Dr. Geidt</a>  implementing parallel clustering algorithms for field theories.
    In my sophomore year, I developed a program implementing the Swendsen-Wang algorithm applied to the Ising model
    on GPUs, and was able to see a speedup of over 17 times while running on a NVIDIA P100 compared to serial execution.
    Currently, I am working to apply similar algorithm to a O(4) Phi Four theory, where I expect to see similar if not
    better performance to the Ising model.  I am also working on learning MPI with the intent of developing a many-core
    implementation as well as further optimizing the GPU version.

<h3>MetroMusic</h3>
<p>
    MetroMusic is an application of the Metropolis algorithm with the intent of generating interesting music.
